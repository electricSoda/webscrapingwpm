# webscrapingwpm
This webscraper only works if you LOCALLY host the index.html file on command line.
Find the directory on which you downloaded this experiment and then type IN THAT DIRECTORY:

python -m http.server 1010

DO NOT CHANGE THE PORT 1010
After that, run the python file by opening another command prompt,
Then type, 

python webscrapingmonkeytypecom.py

(sorry i made the name so long you can change it lul DO NOT CHANGE index.html's NAME !!!! )
Then you get to see my typing application get destroyed with the webscraper's insane 800 word per minute capacity.
